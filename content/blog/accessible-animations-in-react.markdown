I like minimalism. I like minimalism in my room, on my screen, and - as you can see - on my blog. But, even for me, some bells and whistles are cool. I think thoughtful animation can improve user experience. You can spot subtle examples on my website. Some designers or developers may not agree with me. Efficiency may be a top priority for them. But, sometimes, it's not even about preferences.
